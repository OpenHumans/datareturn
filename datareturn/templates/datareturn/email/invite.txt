Thank you for being part of {{ site.siteconfig.source_name }}!

We want to give you access to your raw data from our project. This is the
same data the researchers have, fairly technical files containing a lot of
data. It might not be useful to you, but we wanted to give you access to
everything we have - as a thank you for your contribution!

If you're a member of Open Humans, you can also connect your data to an Open
Humans account. Open Humans is a free, non-profit site where study participants
can aggregate their data from studies, participate in new studies, and
potentially connect to other participants. You can read more about it on their
website: https://openhumans.org
